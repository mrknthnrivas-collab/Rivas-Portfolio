# Rivas--Portfolio

This portfolio was designed with a focus on several key UI/UX principles to ensure a professional and user-friendly experience. A primary principle was simplicity and clarity. The goal was to create a clean, minimalist layout that allows my work to be the main focus, avoiding visual clutter and distractions. I applied this by using ample white space, a limited color palette, and a clear, sans-serif font to enhance readability. Another core principle was consistency, which was maintained across all pages by using a uniform navigation bar, consistent button styles, and standardized card layouts for projects. This reduces cognitive load, allowing users to intuitively navigate from one section to the next.

One of the main challenges I faced was ensuring full responsiveness across various devices. The initial design looked great on a desktop but broke on smaller screens, with elements overlapping or becoming unreadable. To solve this, I implemented a mobile-first approach using CSS Flexbox and Grid, which allowed for a fluid and adaptable layout. By setting breakpoints, I could specifically adjust element sizing, stacking order, and font sizes to ensure a seamless experience, whether on a large monitor or a smartphone.

Looking ahead, the portfolio could be improved by focusing on greater accessibility and adding more dynamic content. I would improve the color contrast ratio to meet WCAG standards and incorporate ARIA labels to make the site more usable for screen readers. I also plan to add subtle animations to draw attention to key interactive elements and include a blog or case study section. This would provide more context behind my design choices and development process, turning the portfolio from a static display into a more engaging and informative resource for potential employers or collaborators.
